# Learning New Skills

In this repository you will find exercises, small projects, notes, and experiments created to practice programming languages and related technologies. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a personal learning workspace where new concepts can be explored, tested, and documented.

What this repo is for:

- Practice different programming languages and frameworks.
- Build small demo projects and prototypes to solidify learning.
- Keep code snippets, solutions to problems, and learning notes.
- Experiment with tools, libraries, and workflows.

How to use it:

- Browse folders to find projects or exercises grouped by topic.
- Open any subfolder, run the included examples, and read the notes.
- Feel free to add your own experiments and document what you learn.

This repository is intentionally flexible — use it as a sandbox for learning, experimenting, and improving your programming skills.
